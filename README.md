# Data_preparation_4_ML_algorithm

The Airbnb database will be used as the primary source of data for this project on data preparation. 

The raw data will be cleaned and processed, including the handling of missing values, removal of irrelevant or redundant data, and addressing inconsistencies. 

Text and categorical attributes, such as property type, neighborhood, and amenities, will also be worked on to transform them into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Feature scaling techniques will be employed to ensure that all the features in the dataset have similar scales, which is crucial for many machine learning algorithms. 

Ultimately, the data will be prepared in a way that can be used to train and evaluate a machine learning model for predicting Airbnb prices. 



The goal of the project is to prepare the data in a way that can be used to train and evaluate a machine learning model, and the project will involve cleaning, processing, and transforming the data to achieve this objective.
